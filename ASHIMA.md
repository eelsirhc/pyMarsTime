### MarsTime library

Christopher Lee, Ashima Research, 2011-

This package implements the Mars24 algorithm in javascript based on the [Allison and McEwen (2000)] paper. Details can be found at [http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/mars24/](http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/mars24/) . Some Documentation for this package can be found at [Read the Docs](http://marstime.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

The library is available under the Modified BSD license. Please retain the references to the algorithm papers by [Allison and McEwen (2000)] and [Allison (1997)]. Publications using the algorithm should reference those papers where appropriate.
